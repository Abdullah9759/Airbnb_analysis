# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data to uncover insights on pricing trends, availability, and location-based patterns.  
The analysis involves **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using Python.  
The goal is to help hosts, travelers, and Airbnb understand factors influencing listing prices and occupancy.

## 📂 Dataset Access
The full dataset is too large to be stored directly on GitHub.  
You can download it here: **[Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vd5p6mh8CQoct_HDHGjuQjAn67ivO_KN/view?usp=drive_link)** 

For quick testing, a **sample dataset** (`airbnb_sample.csv`) is included in this repository.

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. **Data Collection** – Imported Airbnb dataset from CSV.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** –  
   - Price distribution  
   - Listings by neighbourhood  
   - Impact of reviews on price  
   - Availability trends  
4. **Visualization** – Created bar plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to identify correlations.
5. **Insights & Conclusions** – Summarized key findings from the analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Average price varies significantly by neighbourhood.
- Listings with higher reviews tend to have slightly lower prices.
- Some areas have high listing density but lower occupancy rates.
